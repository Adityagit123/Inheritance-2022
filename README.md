## Application

As I have seen farmers closely so I was aware of the problems they faced in their life. The biggest problem I believe they faced was even though putting 100%
of their efforts into the farm they were not able to get what they deserved. The reason for this was the long business chain between the farmers and the 
consumers. Most of the businessmen made profit at different level of this chain making the product costly for the consumer and generating less income for the 
farmers. I wanted to created a link between the farmers and the consumer so that both of them understand what actually the market can be when the grower and 
consumer are brought on the same platform.


## Future Scope
1. Add search bar
2. Add a cart page
3. Add a page where the prices of the item sold by the farmer can be altered daily as per the demand and supply of the goods in the market
4. Online payment feature
5. Extend it in the fertilizer sector
